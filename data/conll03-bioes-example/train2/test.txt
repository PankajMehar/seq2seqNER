Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .	S-MISC O S-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .	O O B-PER I-PER E-PER O S-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .	O O O O S-ORG O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG E-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .	O O O O O O O
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .	B-PER E-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-PER O O S-MISC O O O O O O O O O
He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-LOC O O O O O O S-LOC O O O O O O S-LOC O S-LOC O
Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .

Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim .	S-ORG O O O O S-ORG O S-ORG O O O O O S-ORG O
Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd.

Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .	B-PER E-PER O O O O O O S-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .

Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , " he said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-LOC O O O O O O
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .

" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , " van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland .	O O O O O O O O O S-MISC O O O O O O O O O S-PER O O O O S-ORG O O O O O O S-LOC O

Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil .	O O O O O S-LOC O

Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .	O O O O O O O O O O S-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said .	O O O O O O S-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER E-PER O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG E-ORG O S-ORG O O O O
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences .	O S-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme said .	O O O O O O O O O S-PER O O
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC E-LOC O O O O
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy .	S-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER E-PER O
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-ORG O
Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .	O O O O O O O O O S-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "	S-PER O S-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .	S-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-MISC O O O O O O O O O
" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC E-LOC O O S-ORG O B-PER E-PER O O O
Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . "	O O O O O O O O O O O

Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

" They are now back in the YIT campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone .	O O O O O O O S-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O S-ORG O O O
One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities .	O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG E-ORG O O O O O O O O O
But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were singing peacefully .	O O O O O
On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests .	O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER E-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-LOC O
The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thousands were killed or imprisoned .	O O O O O O
Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus .	O O S-ORG O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG E-ORG O S-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" We still want government answers to our demands .	O O O O O O O O O O
We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER E-PER O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG E-ORG O S-ORG O O
Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students .	B-PER E-PER O O S-MISC O O O O O O B-PER E-PER O O O S-ORG O O O O O O O O O O
But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-LOC O O O O

Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday .	S-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG E-ORG O O O O
K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .	B-PER E-PER O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC E-MISC O S-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O S-PER O O
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .	S-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .	S-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India .
